# Food recipe app using ReactJS
## We are going to make a food recipe app using React.js.

**Pre-requisite:**
React hooks
React components
JavaScript ES6
API 
CSS

Approach: Here in this app we should have a component where we are going to show our food recipes. And we need to fetch all the required food recipes using a food recipe API. We will fetch the API data, store those data in a component structure using react hooks (useEffect, useState ).

Getting food recipe API KEY: First of all we will get all the food recipes by fetching the data from API.  For this, we will use the  platform called EDAMAM.  (  https://developer.edamam.com/ )

First we need to signup and  then go to the APIs section in the navbar.
Click start now in the Developer section.
Then go the Dashboard section(top right)>click Application>in the left side
Thereâ€™s a Recipe Search API option > click view on that section
From there copy your Application ID and Application Keys and store it somewhere.
